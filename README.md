## Description & Purpose

Design Daily is a creative prompt and inspiration tracker that solves the problem of creative stagnation among designers. Many designers struggle with maintaining consistent practice, overcoming creative blocks, and connecting with supportive communities. 

Our app provides:
- **Daily design challenges** to fuel creativity and maintain consistent practice
- **Community engagement** through likes and comments on submissions
- **Portfolio building** by naturally collecting diverse work over time
- **Inspiration discovery** through curated submissions from talented designers

Whether you're a professional looking to stay sharp or an aspiring designer building your portfolio, Design Daily provides structure, motivation, and community engagement all in one place.

## Inspiration

Design Daily was inspired by:
- **Dribbble** - A thriving community for designers to share work and get inspired
- **Daily coding challenges** like LeetCode - The power of structured daily practice
- **Inktober** and similar creative challenges - How themes unite creative communities
- **Habit-tracking apps** - The importance of streaks and consistency in building practice
- **The isolation of creative work** - Designers needed a supportive space that combines challenges, portfolio building, and community

We wanted to create a platform that captures all these elements into one cohesive experience.
