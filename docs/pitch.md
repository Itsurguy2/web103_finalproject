# Design Daily - Pitch

## 2-Minute Elevator Pitch

### **Concept (15 seconds)**

Design Daily is a community-driven design challenge app that delivers a new creative prompt every day to designers of all skill levels. It's like Inktober meets Dribbble‚Äîcombining structured daily challenges with a supportive design community.

### **Problem (20 seconds)**

Designers face three major challenges:
1. **Creative Burnout** - It's hard to stay motivated and inspired when working on real-world projects
2. **Inconsistent Practice** - Without structure, designers skip practice and creative skills atrophy
3. **Isolation** - Many designers work in silos without real feedback or connection to a community

### **Solution (25 seconds)**

Design Daily solves all three problems by providing:
- **Daily prompts** that fuel creativity and maintain consistent practice
- **A supportive community** where you can share work, get likes, and receive constructive comments
- **Progress tracking** that gamifies your design journey with streaks and statistics

Whether you're a professional looking to stay sharp or a student building a portfolio, Design Daily gives you the structure, motivation, and community engagement to keep designing.

### **Key Features (30 seconds)**

- üìå **Daily Design Challenges** - New prompt every day at midnight
- üëÄ **Community Feed** - See what other designers are creating and get inspired
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Engagement** - Like and comment on submissions to support the community
- üìä **Progress Tracking** - View your submissions, streak, and statistics on your profile
- üéØ **Smart Discovery** - Sort by "Most Liked" or "Newest" and filter by design category

### **Why It's Unique (20 seconds)**

Unlike Dribbble (which focuses on finished work showcase) or random prompt generators (which lack community), Design Daily combines:
- Structured daily prompts that keep you accountable
- A diverse community across all design disciplines
- Real-time engagement and feedback
- Automatic portfolio building as a byproduct

### **Business/Usage Opportunity (10 seconds)**

Whether for personal growth, portfolio building, or team challenges, Design Daily creates a habit-forming community that keeps coming back daily. Think of it as a design gym‚Äîwhere showing up every day makes you better.

## Full Pitch Script (2 minutes)

*[Establish presence, make eye contact]*

"Have you ever scrolled through Dribbble and thought, 'I wish I had that level of inspiration and community every single day'? Or felt stuck in your design work with no clear direction on what to work on next?

We're Jesse Goffin, Enoch Owoade, and Joshua Holguin, and we're introducing **Design Daily** ‚Äî a creative challenge platform that delivers fresh design inspiration every single day.

**Here's the problem we're solving:** Designers struggle in three ways. First, creative burnout‚Äîworking on client projects is exhausting and inspiration runs dry. Second, inconsistent practice‚Äîwithout structure, skills get rusty. And third, isolation‚Äîmany designers work alone without meaningful feedback or community.

**Here's our solution:** Design Daily sends a brand new design prompt every day. Whether it's 'design a mobile banking app' or 'create a poster for a music festival,' you have 24 hours to respond. You upload your work, and the community engages with it‚Äîliking, commenting, and providing real feedback.

**What makes this special?** It's not just a prompt generator. It's not just a portfolio site. It combines the best of both worlds:
- Like Inktober, Design Daily creates community around a shared challenge
- Like Dribbble, it's a space to share work and get inspiration
- Like LeetCode, it gamifies practice with streaks and statistics

**The core features** include:
- Daily prompts delivered to your inbox and app
- A vibrant feed of designer submissions filtered by category or sorted by popularity
- Like and comment on work to build community
- A personal profile tracking your progress, streaks, and most-liked work

We built this with React on the frontend, Express on the backend, and PostgreSQL for a robust database that supports complex queries for sorting and filtering. The app automatically generates a new prompt daily, and users can filter by design discipline or sort by popularity to discover inspiration.

**Who uses this?** Professionals wanting to stay sharp. Students building portfolios. Design teams doing collaborative challenges. Anyone who wants to be part of a supportive, creative community.

**Why now?** The design community is fragmented. Dribbble is for finished work. Design challenge sites are boring and impersonal. There's no place where practicing design feels like a community sport‚Äîuntil now.

Design Daily is where practice meets inspiration, where you build your portfolio while discovering incredible work from designers just like you.

We're excited to build this. Thank you."

## Q&A Preparation

### Q: How do you keep prompts fresh and interesting?
**A:** We pre-load a database of 365+ prompts created by experienced designers and UX practitioners. Our scheduler activates one per day. For future scalability, we could incorporate user voting on prompt difficulty, AI-generated variations, or community-submitted prompts.

### Q: How do you prevent low-quality submissions?
**A:** Initially, we rely on community feedback (likes/comments). Users naturally elevate quality work. For future features, we could implement admin curation, flagging systems, or portfolio requirements.

### Q: What about time zones? When does the prompt reset?
**A:** Great question! Currently, we use UTC at midnight. For v2, we could implement time zone localization so each user sees their daily prompt at midnight in their local time.

### Q: How do you handle toxic comments?
**A:** Community guidelines are enforced through:
- User reporting system
- Admin moderation
- Warnings and removal for violators
- Future: AI moderation for obvious toxicity

### Q: Is this just for visual design?
**A:** No! We support UI/UX, Illustration, Branding, Photography, 3D, Motion, Web Design, and more. The diversity of disciplines is a key feature‚Äîyou learn from how other creative professionals approach the same brief.

### Q: How is this different from other design communities?
**A:** 
- **vs. Dribbble:** We focus on daily practice, not finished portfolio pieces
- **vs. Design Challenge Websites:** We emphasize community, not just participation
- **vs. Habit Apps:** We're design-specific and community-driven, not generic goal tracking

### Q: What's the monetization strategy?
**A:** We're currently focused on building a strong user base. Future monetization options include premium analytics, advanced filtering, design template marketplaces, or enterprise team plans.
